# SEC 10-K Filings Analysis

## Project Overview
This project automates the downloading and analysis of SEC 10-K filings for selected companies. It uses Python and several libraries to extract financial insights from these filings, which are then visualized. The insights focus on profitability, cash flow, and revenue growth, derived through text analysis using the LLM API.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Chosen for its robust libraries and ease of handling data manipulation and text analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing HTML content within 10-K filings to extract and clean data.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: Utilized for generating insights from the text data.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of the extracted data.
- **sec-edgar-downloader**: A Python library used for downloading SEC filings directly from the EDGAR database.

### Why this stack?
- **Python** is the de facto choice for data analysis tasks due to its simplicity and the powerful ecosystem of data processing libraries.
- **BeautifulSoup** provides excellent capabilities for parsing disorganized HTML, making it ideal for scraping web documents.
- **OpenAI's API** offers state-of-the-art natural language processing, allowing for high-quality text analysis.
- **Matplotlib** offers extensive support for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **sec-edgar-downloader** simplifies the process of fetching SEC filings, reducing development time and complexity.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
- cd SEC-Filings-Analysis
- Install the correct dependencies

## Analysis and Insights

The program performs the following analyses:
- **Profitability Analysis**: Examines the profitability trend over the selected period.
- **Cash Flow Analysis**: Reviews how cash flow has changed and factors influencing these changes.
- **Revenue Growth Analysis**: Evaluates how revenue has grown and the underlying drivers.

Each insight is supported by visual evidence generated by the program, highlighting key trends and patterns.

## Visualizations

Visualizations are saved in the `outputs` directory. These include line graphs representing trends over time, directly derived from the financial data extracted from the filings.
